print(10 - 1) #Subtraction
print(10 * 2) #Multiplication
print(10 / 1) #Division

#by using "//" we are asking the result of the division 
#to be an integer instead of a float

print(10 // 3)

#The "%" function returns the remainder of a division
#instead of the original awnser

#The "**" function uses the power method, the left number 
#by how many time from the right, 10 * 10 * 10.

#You can use something called the augmented assignment operator
#too shorten code.
