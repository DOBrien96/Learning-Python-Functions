from array import array

numbers = array("i", [1, 2, 3])

#Use arrays when dealing with large data sets where memory is more 
#valuable. The "i"  is called a typecode and you will need to google
#"array typecode" so you can figure out what typecode you need to use
#for your array as each typecode deals with diferent types of data
